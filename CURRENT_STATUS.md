# ChronicleLedger - Quick Start (Simplified)

**Current Status**: CockroachDB has clock sync issues on Windows. Let's start simpler!

##

 ⚡ Simplified Approach

Instead of the full distributed setup immediately, let's build iteratively:

### Option 1: PostgreSQL Only (Fastest Start)
- Use PostgreSQL for both events and read model
- Single database, two schemas
- Event sourcing still works!
- Can migrate to CockroachDB later

### Option 2: Focus on Other Projects First
Your portfolio already has 6 strong projects modernized. ChronicleLedger documentation is impressive and showcases your knowledge even without running code.

 🎯 What Do You Want to Do?

1. **Build Simplified Version** - PostgreSQL only, get something running fast
2. **Debug CockroachDB** - Fix clock sync issue (might take time on Windows)
3. **Move to Other Work** - Come back to this later
